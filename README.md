# MISP-FE

### An alternative frontend to MISP

The idea behind this frontend is to create a more streamlined
interface for end-users. The current MISP frontend is fine
if you're an admin and require all the features provided there,
but if you're, for example, an analyst, it can all look a little
overwhelming and like a spreadsheet that lived near fukushima for
several years after the disaster.

So that's what this is - an analyst-centric pure API client written
in modern Javascript.
